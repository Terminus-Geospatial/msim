# Missile Simulation Tools

## Building msim

It is recommended to create a virtual environment.  There is a script designed to build the environment. 

```bash
./scripts/create-venv.sh
```

## Install environment

For an "in-place" development build, install via the following command:

```bash
pip install -e .[dev]
```
